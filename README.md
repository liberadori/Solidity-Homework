# Solidity-Homework
I built this contract using Solididy on the Kovan Network.
The Test Net address used is 0xA9eE68Bf2e55c251271dCDAeE60Fc571F2Dc9328.

## 1. Associate Profit Splitter

This contract accepts Test Net Ether and divides it evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quicly and efficiently.


## 2. Tiered Profit Splitter

This contract will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. The CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.


## 3. Deferred Equity Plan

This contract models traditional stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 shares over 4 years for a single employee.

Feel free to deploy these contracts to see them in action!
